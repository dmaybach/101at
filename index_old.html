              "This was the first of many years that David has and will prepare my taxes. He is very reliable, trustworthy and insightful on tax laws and regulations. &nbsp;He is not only a great advocate for his clients, but enlightening along the way to make you well-informed of claims and expenses.&nbsp; From my personal experience, I would highly recommend David to other businesses and individuals for their accounting needs." &nbsp;             March, 2011</p>

              With my life being as  full as it is, working production, working on a 2nd draft of my 1st novel, and  launching a new company, David has been a God send in taking care of my company  finances for me. &nbsp;I don't know what I would do without him! &nbsp;Thanks  David!

              I am the Vice-President and business manager for  Electro Lighting, LLC. We have grown by leaps and bounds the past few years and  business is good. We hired David to take over invoicing and basic accounting,  which used to be my duty. I can say that now, having David aboard, life is so  much sweeter. &nbsp;He is very prompt with invoicing and completely on top of  our finances. One of the best moves we' ve made as a small business. Thanks  David! January, 2011</p>

              “Although I did not work with David directly, I know him to be a very detail oriented accountant, hard working, applies himself well, and is always willing to learn something new, which will assist in his career development. David is a pleasure to be around in the office, always friendly, smiling, and genuinely interested in his company and colleagues. In addition to excellent English communication skills, David is a fluent native Spanish speaker. I highly recommend David for any future engagements in his career path.” August 7, 2009</p>

              “As IT Director of Global FX, I worked with David Hidalgo helped us to understand our projects from accounting side, providing all the answers needed based on the company's budget, with out David things wouldn't have worked out as expected in. David is a great professional, I highly recommend him.” October 9, 2009<br />
